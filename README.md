# Microsoft Visual Basic Script Payloads 

Just a bunch of VBScript files I've created over the years, they're mostly harmless but do show the potentially damaging potential VBScript has.

| File name  | Payload description |
| :-------------: | ------------- |
| `CopyThyself.vbs`  | Script that copies itself to the windows startup folder and shows a message box.  |
| `InfiniteLoop.vbs`  | Script that will show a message box that will always stay on top of other windows, and will reopen the message box when clicked away.  |
