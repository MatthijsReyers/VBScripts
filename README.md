# Microsoft Visual Basic Script Payloads 

Just a bunch of VBScript files I've created over the years, they're mostly harmless but do show the potentially damaging potential VBScript has.

| File name  | Payload description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `CopyThyself.vbs`  | File that copies itself to the windows startup folder and shows a message box.  |
